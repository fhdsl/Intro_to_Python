## Install Python on your computer

### Windows

Open up Command Prompt, type: `python3`

Might take you to Microsoft Store to install Python 3.x

### Mac

Open up Terminal, type: `python3`

If nothing comes up, download at: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

## Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our choice, but there are [many other software to consider.](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_python/#python-ide-comparison)

### Install

-   Mac/Windows: <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>

-   Windows: Can be installed from Microsoft Store

## Getting Started

### Script mode:

-   Open up a blank file

-   Put down a Python code, such as `print("hello")`, save it with `.py` extension.

-   Install the Python Extension

-   Run the code

## Getting Started

### Notebook mode:

-   Open Extensions, Install Jupyter Extension

-   Open up New File... -\> Jupyter Notebook

-   Put down Python code, such as `print("hello")`, sand save with `.ipynb` extension.

-   Select Kernel and run it

    -   Install iPython kernel if needed.

## Python Environments

An **"Environment"** in Python is the context in which a Python program runs that consists of an interpreter and any number of installed packages.

-   The "**Global Environment"** is the default Python installation, with its interpreter and installed packages.

-   The "**Local Environment**" is a secondary Python installation, built specifically for a project. It is good practice to always have a local environment in a project you are working on, so that the Python interpreter and package are version controlled.

    -   We will use the Virtual Environment built in Python, but there are other local environment managers such as Conda or miniConda.

## Create your local environment

-   Show and run commands -\> Python: Select Interpreter -\> Create Virtual Environment -\> Venv

    -   You may need to Open as a Workspace, to specify the folder you are working in.

-   You can see and toggle your Environment on the bottom right hand corner.

## Install Python Packages/Modules

### Notebook Mode

-   Select the Python environment you want to be in.

-   Create a new code cell, `%pip install [package name]`

## Install Python Packages/Modules

### Script Mode

-   Select the Python environment you want to be in.

-   Run you script. The Terminal should show up.

-   `/full_path/.venv/bin/python -m pip install [package_name]`

## Staying connected to [DaSL](https://hutchdatascience.org/)

-   Look out for Winter course announcements in about a month!

## Appendix: Create virtual environment from command line

```         
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use `py -3 -m venv .venv`
python -m venv .venv
```

## Appendix: Install Python Packages/Modules from command line

Mac:

```         
% source venv/bin/activate  
(.venv) % python -m pip install [package_name]
```

Windows:

```         
.\venv\Scripts\activate
(.venv) % python -m pip install [package_name]
```

To exit the local environment:

```         
deactivate
```
